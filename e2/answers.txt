Q1. In the hint above, what is the result of the calculation data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept? What is the type, and describe the values. 

The result of this calculation, data['prediction'] = data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept, is the linear regression line of prediction in the dataframe which satisfies the equation y = ax + b with a as the slope, b as the intersect and y as the estimated value.
If we use "type(data['prediction'])" to see, the type of the column is series. For each value, the type is float64 and the value of 'prediction' is between 10.709067516793567 and 14.288548383007559


Q2. In the same hint, why does this produce a fit line on the graph? Why are the created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly to make points on the plot? 

Because the linear regress function in Scipy(stats) can handle the series data conveniently and produce a regression line for us to predict the data. The fit line visually shows a relatively positive relationship between ratings and date time. 

Based on the instruction: data['timestamp'] = data['created_at'].apply(to_timestamp), 'timestamp'(type is float64, a number) is converted from 'created_at'(type is timestamp, a date format). Essentially they are the same, just in different types and purposes. 'Created_at' can be used to give a time axis, while 'timestamp' offer numbers for the fitting line.
