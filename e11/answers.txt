1. In your reddit_relative.py, what intermediate results did you .cache()? Briefly describe what would have happened if you hadn't used .cache() anywhere.(No need to time it, unless you really want to.) 

I use the first .cache() after read.json(), which is comments.cache(). This because 'comments' is used more than once.
I also used a second .cache() groupby, which is max_relativ.cache(). Same reason as above.
By adding these cache() at this location, my program will run faster.



2. How did marking DataFrames for broadcast affect the running time of the "best author" program above? 

With broadcast:
real	0m43.498s
user	0m28.184s
sys	0m2.220s

Without broadcast:
real	1m5.216s
user	0m36.044s
sys	0m2.340s

Thus, using broadcast can improve 22 seconds.
